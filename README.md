Codesandbox Discord Bot token leak repository
This gist hosts leaked previously-active bot tokens found on https://codesandbox.io/.

These tokens were left by developers in a publicly available project.

Is it dangerous to leak tokens ?
No.

You are lucky I found your token and leaked it here. Why ? Because now your token is dead, no one can use it anymore. You bot is safe.

It's better to disclose leaked tokens on github like this, because Discord will instantaneously detect them and invalidate the tokens, preventing anyone from impersonating your bot.

You will have to regenerate them in order to run your bot again.

You should have received an e-mail + private message from the discord system about this issue (and this is probably why you ended up here).

I will not leak tokens with less than 30+ overall guild users, because I understand people may actually need codesandbox to develop their bot. The goal is to prevent growing bots from putting the privacy of hundreds if not thousands of users at risk.

Keep in mind you are responsible for the safety of your secret tokens. You should NOT leave actively used tokens on publicly available repositories, and that includes codesandbox.

STOP ASKING FOR ADMINISTRATION RIGHTS
Unless you are remotely administrating your whole discord guild from outside Discord, you have no reason to ask for full administration rights. There are way too many boys who ask for admin rights in their invite link. Developers who prepare the invite's permissions scope are so lazy that they don't take a few minutes reviewing what permission their bot needs to work properly.

If you are a server owner running discord bots, you should not invite bots as admin, change their permissions manually before inviting them.

If you are a bot developer, don't ask for it.

Consequences of being admin :

Can ban users
Can delete channels, messqges
Can read any private channel
Can change anyone's username
Can spam the whole server without restrictions
Can create invite links
Can create web hooks
...
Discord Team, if you read this, it could be great to be able to change permissions before adding a bot to a guild.

As I'm writing this, more than 75% bots I found are admin by default.

Who are you ?
I am a junior cybersecurity consultant, and I usually pentest stuff. You can contact me on Discord ashtonprott if you want to talk !
